  In the GIF above, we're setting up an environment to use a <b>mobile phone's</b> gyroscope to control the in-game camera. Get started by following the steps below:
  * Download our scripts.
  * Include them in the <b>Assets folder</b> of your Unity library.
  * Select the <b>Main Camera</b> object in your scene.
  * Add our Camera Controller script as a component in the inspector panel.
  * Drag a player object into the Camera Controller component.
