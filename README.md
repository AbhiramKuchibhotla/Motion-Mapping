<h2> Note: </h2>

  In the GIF above, we're setting up an environment to use a <b>mobile phone's</b> gyroscope to control the in-game camera. Get started by following the steps below:
  * Download our scripts.
  * Include them in the <b>Assets folder</b> of your Unity library.
  * Select the <b>Main Camera</b> object in your scene.
  * Add our <b>Camera Controller script</b> as a component in the inspector panel.
  * Drag a player object into the Camera Controller component.  
   

<h3> Setting up Unity Remote </h3>
 To use a phone with the Unity editor, download Unity Remote 4 from the app store. Also be sure to modify the mobile device Unity expects. In the Unity editor menubar, visit Edit > Project settings > Editor, and under Unity Remote, change the tab pulldown to your phone. (Android users -- you still have more to configure for unity remote. Find any of the tutorials on google).
 
<h2> Real-Time Audio </h2>
  * To be released shortly.
